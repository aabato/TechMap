# TechMap

## What is it?

**TechMap** is an app that accesses the Meetups API to gather Technology meetups around your current location. You can view the results either on a map or in list form. Tap on marker summaries or the table view rows to see more information about the meetup.

## To Run

There are a couple of things to have this project run on your machine. \n
1. The Pods folder was not pushed to the github repository. Please run `pod install` before opening the project.
2. I did not include API keys. Please gather that yourself and place it in a property list file named `Keys.plist`
